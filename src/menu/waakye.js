        </div>    

            <p><strong>Waakye</strong> is a supremely popular morning meal in Ghana but can be eaten throughout the day. Filling and flavourful, it combines beans, rice, moist gari (ground cassava), stew and spaghetti (the only non-Ghanaian part of the dish).</p>

            <p>This is one of the most cherished Ghanaian dish in most households in Ghana. As the name suggests, the main ingredients in this dish are; rice and beans which are both boiled in water with millet leaves till they become soft. The delicacy is named after the millet leaves which are locally referred to as <mark>waakye.</mark></p>

            <p>It is normally accompanied by yellowish granulated cassava, tomato sauce, and a hot black pepper sauce referred to as ‘shito’. Waakye is eaten with mostly cow meat and eggs, but others also add chicken or guinea fowl.</p>

            <div class="ul-adjusted">        
            <li>2 cups of black eyed beans</li>
            <li>2-4 dried millet stalk leaves</li>
            <li>4 cups of jasmine rice</li>
            <li>3 tbsp of oil</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>          
            </div>
    
        <div class="ol-adjusted">       
            <li>Pick stones and grits from the beans</li>
            <li>Wash the beans and add into the pressure cooker</li>
            <li>Wash the waakye leaves and also add into the pressure cookers. Pour in water up to the minimum level on the pot</li>
            <li>Close the valve of the pressure cooker and leave until it reaches full pressure. This should take no more than 15 mins</li>
            <li>Once it reaches full pressure, reduce the heat and leave for additional 10 mins for the beans to cook</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and allow to cool down naturally to depressurize. This should take around 20 mins</li>
            <li>Once the pot is adequately cooled. Unlock the lid. Pour the beans with the cooking liquid and the waakye leaves into another pot. Wash the rice and pour into the pot too</li>
            <li>Add more water if needed so there is enough to cook the rice. Add some salt and cover the pot</li>
            <li>Allow the rice to cook. The time for this depends on the type of rice used. Check pack instructions if you are not sure</li>
            <li>Remove the waakye leaves and serve with your favorite side</li>
